## Problem Analysis

### Input
- The program uses fixed values for:
  - `n` (size for some patterns) set to `6`.
  - `rows` set to `7` (for the hollow rectangle pattern).
  - `columns` set to `8` (for the hollow rectangle pattern).
- The patterns generated do not require user input; they are predefined and printed directly.

### Processing
1. Start the program.
2. Define the necessary variables:
   - `n`, `rows`, and `columns`.
3. Generate each pattern using for nested loops:
   - **Pattern 1:** Loop through numbers and print them in rows.
   - **Pattern 2:** Loop through letters, incrementing for each row.
   - **Pattern 3:** Print an incremental triangle of numbers using nested loops.
   - **Pattern 4:** Print decreasing numbers in a right-aligned triangle.
   - **Pattern 5:** Print letters in an incremental triangle.
   - **Pattern 6:** Print lowercase letters from 'a' to 'e'.
   - **Pattern 7:** Create a hollow rectangle using conditional printing.
   - **Pattern 8:** Print an inverted triangle of stars.
   - **Pattern 9:** Print a hollow inverted triangle.
   - **Pattern 10:** Print a left-aligned triangle of stars.
   - **Pattern 11:** Print a right-aligned triangle of stars.
   - **Pattern 12:** Print a hollow left-aligned triangle.
4. Print each generated pattern to the console.
5. End the program.  

### Output
- The program generates and displays a series of patterns, including:
  1. **Pattern 1:** Numbers from 1 to 5, printed in 5 rows.
  2. **Pattern 2:** Letters A to F, printed in 4 rows.
  3. **Pattern 3:** An incremental triangle of numbers.
  4. **Pattern 4:** A right-aligned triangle of decreasing numbers.
  5. **Pattern 5:** An incremental triangle of letters.
  6. **Pattern 6:** Lowercase letters from 'a' to 'e' printed in 5 rows.
  7. **Pattern 7:** A hollow rectangle of stars.
  8. **Pattern 8:** An inverted triangle of stars.
  9. **Pattern 9:** A hollow inverted triangle of stars.
  10. **Pattern 10:** A left-aligned triangle of stars.
  11. **Pattern 11:** A right-aligned triangle of stars.
  12. **Pattern 12:** A hollow left-aligned triangle of stars.
