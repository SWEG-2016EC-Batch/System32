# File Transfer Time Calculation Program

## Problem Analysis
The purpose of this program is to calculate the time required to transfer a file over a serial transmission line that can send 960 characters per second. The program will take the size of the file in bytes as input and compute the time needed to transfer this file, displaying the result in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

### Requirements
1. **Input**:
   - File size in bytes.
   
2. **Calculations**:
   - Total seconds required to transfer the file = File size / Transfer rate.
   - Convert total seconds into:
     - Days
     - Hours
     - Minutes
     - Seconds

3. **Output**:
   - Display the total time required in a human-readable format.

## Algorithm
1. **Start** the program.
2. **Declare** variables for file size, transfer rate, total time, and time components (days, hours, minutes, seconds).
3. **Prompt** the user to enter the file size in bytes.
4. **Calculate** the total seconds required for transfer:
   - `total_seconds = file_size / transfer_rate`
5. **Calculate** days:
   - `days = total_seconds / 86400`
6. **Calculate** hours:
   - `hours = (total_seconds % 86400) / 3600`
7. **Calculate** minutes:
   - `minutes = (total_seconds % 3600) / 60`
8. **Calculate** seconds:
   - `seconds = total_seconds % 60`
9. **Display** the total transfer time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
10. **End** the program.
## Pseudocode  

START

DEFINE transfer_rate = 960 // characters per second

DECLARE file_size, total_seconds, days, hours, minutes, seconds

OUTPUT "Enter the file size in bytes:"

INPUT file_size

// Calculate total seconds required to transfer the file
total_seconds = file_size / transfer_rate

// Calculate days, hours, minutes, and seconds
days = total_seconds / 86400
hours = (total_seconds % 86400) / 3600
minutes = (total_seconds % 3600) / 60
seconds = total_seconds % 60

OUTPUT "The file transfer will take " + days + " day(s), " + hours + " hour(s), " + minutes + " minute(s), and " + seconds + " second(s)."
