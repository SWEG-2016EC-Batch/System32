Problem Analysis
The program calculates the time required to transmit a file over a network given a fixed transmission rate of 960 bytes per second. The result is expressed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
1. Input
The program requires the user to input:
file_size: The size of the file in bytes (a positive number).
Validation: The file size must be greater than zero. If not, an error message is displayed, and the program terminates.
2. Processing
Calculate Total Transmission Time: The transmission_rate is given as 960 bytes per second.
Total Time in Seconds: total_time_seconds= file size / transmission_rate
Conversion to Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds:
Days: Calculate the number of complete days: days = total_time_seconds / (24 × 3600)
Update remaining seconds after calculating days:
remaining_seconds = total_time_seconds % ( 24 × 3600)
Hours: Calculate the number of complete hours from the remaining seconds:
hours = remaining_seconds / 3600
Update remaining seconds after calculating hours:
remaining_seconds = remaining_seconds % 3600
Minutes: Calculate the number of complete minutes:
minutes = remaining_seconds / 60
​Seconds: The final remaining seconds:
seconds = remaining_seconds % 60
3. output
Time to transmit the file: The program outputs the total time required for file transmission, broken down into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.


Algorithm
step 1: Start.
step 2: Prompt the user to input the file size in bytes.
step 3: Validate Input: If file_size <= 0, display an error message and terminate the program.
step 4: Calculate Total Transmission Time in Seconds: total_time_seconds = file_size / transmission_rate
step 5: Convert Total Seconds to Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds as:
 step 5.1: Days: days = total_time_seconds / 24 × 3600
 step 5.2: Update total_time_seconds: total_time_seconds = total_time_seconds % ( 24 × 3600 )
 step 5.3: Hours: hours = total_time_seconds / 3600
 step 5.4: Update total_time_seconds: total_time_seconds=total_time_seconds%3600
 step 5.5: Minutes: minutes = total_time_seconds / 60
 step 5.6: Update total_time_seconds: seconds=total_time_seconds % 60
step 6: Display the time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
step 7: End.
