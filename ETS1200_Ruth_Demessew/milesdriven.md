Problem Analysis
The program calculates how far a car can travel on a full tank of gas based on user input for the fuel tank's capacity in gallons and the car's mileage in miles per gallon.

1. Inputs:
gallon_capacity: The capacity of the car's fuel tank in gallons.
milesPerGallon: The distance the car can travel per gallon of gas (mileage).
2. Processing:
The program computes the total distance the car can travel without refueling using the formula:
distance = gallon_capacity × milesPerGallon
distance = gallon_capacity×milesPerGallon
3. Outputs:
The total distance the car can travel without refueling.


Algorithm
step 1: Start.
step 2: Prompt the user to input the fuel tank's capacity in gallons (gallon_capacity).
step 3: Prompt the user to input the mileage in miles per gallon (milesPerGallon).
step 4: Compute the distance using the formula: distance = gallon_capacity × milesPerGallon
step 5: Display the result: "The car can travel [distance] miles without refueling."
step 6: End.
