pseudocode
Step 1: start

Step 2: Declare variables:
 
tankCapacity as float
milesPerGallon as float
totalDistance as float
Step 3: Display the message:

"Enter the capacity of the fuel tank (in gallons):"
Step 4: Input tankCapacity.

Step 5: Display the message:

"Enter the miles per gallon (MPG):"
Step 6: Input milesPerGallon.

Step 7: Calculate totalDistance:

Set totalDistance = tankCapacity * milesPerGallon.
Step 8: Display the message:

"The automobile can be driven for ", totalDistance, " miles without refueling."
Step 9: end.
