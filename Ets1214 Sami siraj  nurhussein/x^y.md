Problem Analysis

This is a simple C++ program that calculates the power of a number. The program asks the user to input two floating-point numbers, ( x ) and ( y ), then calculates ( x^y ) 
(x raised to the power of y) using the pow function from the <cmath> library, and finally outputs the result.

Key Components:
Input: The program prompts the user for two floating-point numbers:  x, the base, and  y, the exponent.
Processing: The program computes the power using the pow function, which returns  x raised to the power of  y.

pseudocode

step1:Begin

step2:Declare variables to store values of x, y and result of power calculation.

step3: Ask the user to input the value of ( x ).

step4: Input value of ( x ).

step5: Ask the user to input the value of ( y ).

step6: Input value of ( y ).

step6: Compute the value of ( x ) raised to the power of ( y ) using pow function and store it in the variable power.

step7: Print the result to the user.

step8: Stop
