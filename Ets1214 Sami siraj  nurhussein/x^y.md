Problem Analysis
The provided code is a simple C++ program that calculates the power of a number. The program prompts the user to input two floating-point numbers, ( x ) and ( y ), and then computes ( x^y ) 
(x raised to the power of y) using the pow function from the <cmath> library. Finally, it outputs the result.

Key Components:
Input: The program takes two floating-point numbers from the user: ( x ) (the base) and ( y ) (the exponent).
Processing: It calculates the power using the pow function, which returns ( x ) raised to the power of ( y ).

pseudocode

step1:Start
step2:Declare variables to hold the values of ( x ), ( y ), and the result of the power calculation.
step3Prompt the user to enter the value for ( x ).
step4:Read the input value for ( x ).
step5:Prompt the user to enter the value for ( y ).
step6:Read the input value for ( y ).
step6:Calculate ( x ) raised to the power of ( y ) using the pow function and store the result in the variable power.
step7:Display the result to the user.
step8:End
