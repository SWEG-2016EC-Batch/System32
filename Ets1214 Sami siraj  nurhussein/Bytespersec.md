Problem Analysis
Problem Statement:

We are to determine how long it takes to transmit a file across a serial transmission line that sends at a rate of 960 characters per second. The user will provide the size of the file in bytes.
Inputs:

The size of the file in bytes (integer).
Outputs:

The time to transmit the file in seconds (floating-point number).
Constraints:

The file size must be greater than or equal to zero (0 or greater).


Input data and expected output Each character in the file is represented by 1 byte.
BEGIN

  Constants
    DEFINE CHAR_SIZE AS 1                
    DEFINE TRANSMISSION_RATE AS 960     

 Variables
    DECLARE fileSize AS INTEGER
    DECLARE fileSizeCharacters AS DOUBLE
    DECLARE timeSeconds AS DOUBLE
    
pseudocode

step 1: start

Step 2: get the user input
    PRINT "Enter the file size in bytes: "
    READ fileSize


   Step 3: Input validation
    IF fileSize < 0 THEN
        PRINT "File size cannot be negative."
        EXIT


Step 4: Determine the number of characters in the file
    fileSizeCharacters = fileSize / CHAR_SIZE

    
Step 5: Compute the time to transmit the file
timeSeconds = fileSizeCharacters / TRANSMISSION_RATE

 Step 6: Output the result
PRINT "Time to transmit the file: ", timeSeconds, " seconds
step 7: End
