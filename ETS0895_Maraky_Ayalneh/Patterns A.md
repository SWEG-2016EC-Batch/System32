#  Printing Patterns 

 This program generates a variety of patterns using nested loops. The patterns include numeric grids, alphabet sequences, triangular structures, and star-based designs. Each pattern is displayed in a formatted manner using nested `for` loops, with careful attention to spacing, alignment, and conditions.

### Input
- No external input is required; all values and conditions are hardcoded into the program.

### Process
1. **Numeric Grid**: 
   - Use two nested `for` loops. The outer loop controls rows, while the inner loop prints numbers `1` to `5` repeatedly.

2. **Alphabet Rectangle**:
   - Use a `char` variable starting from `'A'`. Increment the character inside nested loops to print sequential alphabets in a rectangular format.

3. **Right-Angled Triangle of Numbers**:
   - Use nested loops, with the inner loop printing numbers incrementally up to the current row number.

4. **Inverted Pyramid of Numbers**:
   - Use nested loops with a decreasing sequence of numbers and leading spaces for alignment.

5. **Alphabet Triangle**:
   - Use nested loops to print alphabets incrementally in each row, starting from `'A'`.

6. **Lowercase Alphabet Grid**:
   - Use nested loops to print a grid of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'e'`).

7. **Hollow Square of Stars**:
   - Use nested loops and conditional statements to print `*` only on the borders of the square.

8. **Inverted Right-Angled Triangle of Stars**:
   - Use nested loops with the number of stars decreasing in each subsequent row.

9. **Hollow Inverted Triangle**:
   - Use nested loops with conditions to print stars `*` only at specific positions in each row.

10. **Pyramid of Stars**:
    - Use nested loops to print an increasing number of stars `*` in a pyramid shape, with appropriate spacing for alignment.

11. **Inverted Pyramid of Stars**:
    - Use nested loops to print a decreasing number of stars `*` in a reverse pyramid, with leading spaces for alignment.

12. **Hollow Pyramid of Stars**:
    - Use nested loops and conditions to print stars only at the edges of the pyramid, with spaces in between.

### Output
- **Numeric Patterns**: Displayed as grids, triangles, and pyramids of numbers.
- **Alphabet Patterns**: Displayed as grids or triangular formations of uppercase or lowercase letters.
- **Star Patterns**: Displayed in various shapes like squares, triangles, pyramids (filled and hollow).
